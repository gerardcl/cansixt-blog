I am a M.Sc. Telecomunications Engineer from the [Universitat Polit√®cnica de Catalunya](https://www.upc.edu/).

Currently working as a Backend Engineer at [BI X](https://www.bix-digital.com). Working together with awesome UX Researchers and Designers, Data Scientists, Frontend Engineers and Agile Coaches.

I believe technology can solve a lot of problems, and I try to build digital products with the goal to help people.

Advocate of [OpenSource Software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software) and [Hardware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_hardware), and I consider myself ü¶Ä [Rustacean](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and üêç [Pythonista](https://www.python.org/).

I love nature and I am also learning about [permaculture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permaculture) and [syntropic farming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernst_G%C3%B6tsch).
