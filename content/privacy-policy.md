## SECTION 1: WHO WE ARE

Our website address is [https://blog.cansixt.cat](https://blog.cansixt.cat). Privacy information is controlled by the owners (authors) of this site who can be reached via [e-mail](mailto:contact@cansixt.cat).

## SECTION 2: WHAT PERSONAL DATA WE COLLECT AND WHY WE COLLECT IT

**In Short**: We collect personal information that you provide to us. Some information — such as your
Internet Protocol (IP) address and/or browser and device characteristics — is collected automatically
when you visit our website.

### EMBEDDED CONTENT FROM OTHER WEBSITES

Articles on this site may include embedded content (e.g. YouTube, Pinterest, WordPress.org, Ads etc.).
Embedded content from other websites behaves in the exact same way as if the visitor has visited the
other website. These websites may collect data about you, use cookies, embed additional third-party
tracking, and monitor your interaction with that embedded content, including tracing your interaction
with the embedded content if you have an account and are logged into that website.

### TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES

We may use cookies and similar tracking technologies (like web beacons and pixels) to access or store information. Specific information about how we use such technologies and how you can refuse certain cookies is set out in our Cookie Notice (click on "Manage cookie settings" button in the footer to load it).

## SECTION 3: WHO WE SHARE YOUR DATA WITH

The data collected may be shared with service providers and others who help with our business operations (if any) and assist in the delivery of our products and services (if any) including, but not limited to:

- application development,
- site hosting,
- maintenance,
- data analysis,
- infrastructure provision,
- IT services,
- customer service,
- email delivery services,
- payment processing,
- marketing,
- analytics, and
- enforcement of our Terms of Service Agreement and other agreements;

    Other users of the site to identify you to anyone to whom you send messages or make comments through the Services;

    Persons or entities with whom you consent to have your Personal Data shared;

    Third parties in order to prevent damage to our property (tangible and intangible), for safety reasons, or to collect amounts owed to us;

    Merchants and payment processors; and

    Third parties as we believe necessary or appropriate, in any manner permitted under applicable law, including laws outside your country of residence.

We do this to: comply with legal process; respond to requests from public and government authorities, including public and government authorities outside your country of residence; enforce our Terms of Service Agreement and other agreements; protect our operations; protect our rights, privacy, safety or property, and/or that of our affiliates, you, or others; and allow us to pursue available remedies or limit the damages that we may sustain.

We will never sell, rent, or lease your Personal Data to a third party.

## SECTION 4: HOW LONG WE RETAIN YOUR DATA

If you leave a comment, the comment and its metadata are retained for one year. This is so we can recognize and approve any follow-up comments automatically instead of holding them in a moderation queue.

For users that register on our website (if any), we also store the personal information they provide in their user profile. All users can see, edit, or delete their personal information at any time (except they cannot change their username). Website administrators can also see and edit that information.

Analytics data is retained indefinitely.

Contact forms are held for one year.

## SECTION 5: WHAT RIGHTS YOU HAVE OVER YOUR DATA

If you have an account on this site, or have left comments, you can request to receive an exported file of the personal data we hold about you, including any data you have provided to us. You can also request that we erase any personal data we hold about you. This does not include any data we are obliged to keep for administrative, legal, or security purposes.

## SECTION 6: WHERE WE SEND YOUR DATA

Visitor comments may be checked through an automated spam detection service. Third parties have access to your data as noted within this agreement.

## ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

We will retain your Personal Data for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy unless a longer retention period is required or allowed by law.

## INFORMATION FROM MINORS

We do not knowingly collect data from or market to children under 18 years of age.
