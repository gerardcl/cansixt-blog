Finally, after thinking a lot about it, we have made it. I feel we have now a solid foundation to start our Blog, about topics that matter to us.
Such topics will jump around **S**ustainability, **H**ealth, **I**nnovation and **T**echnology. And, as Catalan people that we are, we've managed to relate it to shit, our shit. But, don't get it wrong; since we are all humans, we believe shit matters to all of us. Hence, here we are, we are starting such a journey with you.

Think about it: we are all consumers of content around the different media, name it Internet, Newspapers, Magazines, Blogs, Vblogs, and whatnot. But, certainly, we can all be producers of it too. We all have something to share, that might be useful to someone or perhaps even inspire anyone. And, such an idea has been growing in our minds until today, that we have officially created this blog site, together with this first post.

# Why about S.H.I.T.

Yes, we all have a lot of shit to share, so we do. But, seriously speaking, we want to talk about good shit.

And, call it coincidence or not, we found ourselves in a crazy and fun interjection of concepts here:

- we like talking about shit (which is a healthy habit if you think about it)
- the word shit is an acronym, which we will explain through the following [acrostic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acrostic):

## Sustainability

The sentence `we believe in leaving the world at least as good as we found it` is as powerful as living in an as much as possible sustainable way.

## Health

`We observe, learn and practise for a healthy lifestyle`, and if not, how would we be able to create good shit?

## Innovation

`The way to survive in this world and maybe help others` is only possible if we are creative and apply such creativity to specific goals.

## Technology

`We want technology to be of good use and for our needs`, if not then this is not sustainable nor healthy nor innovative at all.

Long story short, in this first post we wanted to explain what this blog site is going to be about, providing a good set of expectations and reasoning the main *categories* one will find here, and that we matter.

We want to have fun by doing it, therefore we hope we can transmit and create such fun on you when reading our thoughts, learnings, ideas... with you!

Talk soon in another post, latest!

*From the Can Sixt inhabitants*.
